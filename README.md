# Absinthe

- A script i wrote just for practicing programming and because i had to translate LOADS of sentences with synonyms.
- The script connects to an italian website, so the input sentence must be in Italian.
- The function of this script is, given a sentence, find the possibles synonyms for every word you choose, creating a file with the possible variants of that sentence.
- It may be useless to other but demonstrates how to extract text from a webpage and process it.
- Contains some bugs, like dealing with Unicode Characters!
